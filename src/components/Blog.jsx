    <p><span className='text-2xl md:text-xl font-bold '>C</span>hange is what drives today's world, and in order to stay alive in this race, we must keep pace with it. However, people are so hasty in this race to learn advanced methodologies and techniques that they neglect the foundational values of organizations. These foundational values are everlasting and are meant to be kept in mind for the success of an organization. <br /><br />

Research suggests that the reason why many companies fail is not that they fail to learn the new stuff that comes along, but because <b>they fail to implement with excellence the timeless principles we already know to be true</b>. So why not take some time to understand these fundamental principles and techniques?</p><br />

       <h2 className='text-2xl md:text-xl font-bold bg-yellow-200 w-fit p-1    rounded-lg'>Management: <span className='text-xl serif font-semibold'> First Steps</span></h2><br />
       <p >
       The skill to manage a big organization doesn't come out of thin air. It has to start from a small step, and that small step is <span className='font-bold'>"self-management."</span>
       </p> <br />
       <p >Everyone knows that being organized will make their work more productive and help them make much better decisions. However, what stops most people from doing so is the amount of work it requires at the start. <br /> They are not willing to do the extra work of planning and making lists because they feel it will just add more work to their already overburdened lives. And sometimes, they even try to make plans but end up over-planning and not doing a thing.
       </p>
       <br />
       <p >Finding the right balance might difficult but crucial for avoiding the feeling of uneasiness that comes from wasting your entire day while lying down and scrolling through Instagram.</p>
      <br />
      <p ><span className='font-semibold'>Some things to consider while trying to organize your life are:</span>
      <ol className='list-decimal list-inside'><br />
        <li className='font-bold'><span className='border-b-4 border-yellow-400'> Start Small</span></li>
        <p>Most people, when trying to make a big change in their life, start with big steps that get them demotivated and exhausted. They try to do everything in one go, which leaves them not wanting to do anything for a long time. To avoid that, start slow with things like organizing your room. In Buddhism, <span className='font-bold'>an organized room is a way to an organized mind.</span></p><br />

        <li className='font-bold'><span className='border-b-4 border-yellow-400'> Don't Multitask</span> </li>
        <p> When asked, most people will say that they can multitask, but according to research, only <span className='font-bold'> 2 percent</span> of people can <span className='font-bold'>multitask effectively</span>. People think they are multitasking effectively, but they are only reducing their productivity in all the tasks they have in hand simultaneously. So try to focus on one task at a time.
        </p><br />

        <li className='font-bold'><span className='border-b-4 border-yellow-400'> Remove Distractions</span> </li>
        <p>
        Mobile phones were made to help us, but now they are doing us more harm than good. The kind of sensory pleasures they provide has led our brains to <span className='font-bold'> crave distraction</span>. It has similar effects to those of tobacco. Because of this, our attention span is decreasing day by day. So try to live in a distraction-free environment. Put your smartphone in another room while you are working.

        </p>
        <br />
        <li className='font-bold'><span className='border-b-4 border-yellow-400'> Maintain Consistency</span> </li>
        <p>Try not to break the streak. Stick with your schedule and do things according to it. Even if you break the streak because of some situations, try to start again as soon as possible.</p> <br />
      </ol>
      </p>

      <h2 className='text-2xl md:text-xl font-bold bg-yellow-200 w-fit p-1    rounded-lg'>Values: <span className='text-xl serif font-semibold'> Organizational and Personal</span></h2><br />

      <p>
      When asked to define values, they are like guides to us. <b>A set of non-negotiable values that should not be compromised in any situation </b>is far too neglected at both the organizational and personal levels.
      </p><br />
      <p>One of the companies that didn't do so is <b> Hewlett-Packard (HP)</b>. The early papers from the meetings of HP suggested that their founders were not just going after a product, but were building an <b>organization with values</b>. They believed that <i> "if we build the right organization with values, it will do remarkable things" </i>.</p><br />
      <p>Research conducted in 1989 suggests that most of the companies that thrive today with great profit do so because they were built upon a set of solid core values that were not negotiable.</p><br />
      <p>These values are just as important at a personal level. We need to have values that we do not negotiate even in the face of adversity. <br /> I have seen people boast about honesty being one of their values while they badmouth people behind their backs. They try to showcase a set of values that are considered "good" in societal norms without actually implementing them because what they seek is just external validation. <br /> This leads to mistrust among people both at the personal and organizational levels.</p><br />
      

      <h2 className='text-2xl md:text-xl font-bold bg-yellow-200 w-fit p-1    rounded-lg'>Leadership: <span className='text-xl serif font-semibold'> What it means</span></h2><br />
      <p>
      The idea of leadership excites anyone. Everyone wants to be a leader because of the cool vibe it gives. Leaders are like superheroes who save the people behind them from tough situations. And everyone wants to be a superhero. <br />
      But leadership also requires both management and values. Leadership without them is inefficient and disastrous.
      </p><br />
      <p>
      Leadership has a hierarchy: <br />
      <ul className='list-disc list-inside'>
        <li><span className='font-bold'>Level 1</span>: Individual capabilities to handle yourself or, we can say, self-management.</li>
        <li><span className='font-bold'>Level 2</span>: Your ability to work well with others. These are team-level capabilities.</li>
        <li><span className='font-bold'>Level 3</span>: Effective and competent management that can help in well-organized execution plans.</li>
        <li><span className='font-bold'>Level 4</span>: The additional ability to set a direction for the organization and lead towards it.</li>
        <li><span className='font-bold'>Level 5</span>: Humility.</li>
      </ul><br />
      <p>People have a characteristic of making everything about themselves. They have pride in their individuality and sort of work in I's and Me's. But a characteristic that separates great leaders from good leaders is their <b>humility</b>. Their ability to not make everything about themselves. Their ability to grow with everyone. They focus on <b>collective success</b> over individual success.
      </p><br />
      <p>Great leaders are self-aware of the fact that it is not they who make the organization, but it is the contribution of all the people in the organization. They prioritize the well-being of the whole team. They maintain a modest view of their own importance and acknowledge their own mistakes.
      <br />
      Adopting humility can make it much easier to ensure smooth collaboration among teams. We are humans, and humans crave importance. This craving for importance is what made people build an industry out of stones and fires. Suggesting that you are more important than others will just result in resentment and inefficiency. This is true for both organizational and personal levels.
      </p>

      </p><br />
      <h2 className='text-2xl md:text-xl font-bold bg-yellow-200 w-fit p-1    rounded-lg'>Conclusion</h2><br />
      <p>In conclusion, for organizational or large-scale success, we need to adopt <b>foundational principles</b>. These principles can be practiced at a personal level and are of great benefit. So, instead of just running ahead to keep up with the modern world, try to look back at history and the great ideas it can teach us.</p>
